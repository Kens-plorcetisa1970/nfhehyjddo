Just left the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Woman in the Yard, and well... that was an experience. Like, I’m not quite sure if it was the   or the uncomfortable seat that left my mind more tangled. First of all, let’s just talk about the colors—like a thrift store painting come to life, beautiful yet kinda jarring at the same time. It’s like they tried to convince my eyes to believe in a new color. Spoiler alert: my eyes are skeptical.

So, there’s this woman—obviously, the one in the title because why not be straightforward? She's got this sort of I’ve seen it all and I’m over it vibe. She lingers in this yard, and at times, I’m questioning if she's rooted there like one of those garden gnomes, only more existentially confused. But truth be told, she's the kind of character you just can’t help but 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 because maybe she’s about to reveal the secret meaning of life... or just water the flowers, whatever comes first.

The plot? Or was there a plot? It felt like a series of three a.m. thoughts spread across two hours. Which I guess is kind of brilliant? The kind of brilliance you ponder when you’re out of caffeine. I tried to follow what was happening, but you know how your brain randomly remembers a meme in the middle of a serious conversation? Yeah, that was me, except instead of a meme, it was that guy sitting two rows ahead adjusting his hat for the fifteenth time. 

> At one point, I think I questioned my existence more than the characters did theirs. But maybe that’s the point, or maybe I need new glasses. 

The soundtrack was like a cat walking on a piano, but somehow that awkwardness became charming. Do you ever get frustrated because something sounds like it might eventually make sense? That’s what it was, a musical enigma taunting my neurons.

Ah! And here’s the part where I totally didn’t expect Python to pop into my head:
```python
def 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩_ (time_spent, confusion_level):
    if confusion_level > time_spent:
        return Why is the cat in the yard?
    else:
        return What did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩?

result = 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩_ (120, 150)
print(result)
```
Did I just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 a thought virus? Who knows.

If you’re into artsy 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 that make you question your sanity while also kinda teaching you about patience—oh, my patience!—then I guess you should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 this. But also, maybe bring a friend to translate the metaphors into relatable nonsense. Because if anything, The Woman in the Yard is a journey... one that leads you right back to the baffling reality of your own backyard.
